Agnos - The Agnostic RPC Framework

Agnos is a cross-platform, cross-language RPC framework.

==============================================================================

How to run the Agnos Toolchain from a cloned repository:

1) Clone this repository

2) Create a symlink (on Windows use mklink) to agnos_compiler/src and place
   it somewherein your PYTHONPATH, e.g.:
   
   ln -s /absolute/path/of/this/repo/agnos_compiler/src /usr/lib/python2.6/site-packages/agnos_compiler
   
   Note: the link should be named "agnos_compiler"

3) Create a symlink to libagnos/python/src and place it somewhere in your 
   PYTHONPATH, e.g:

   ln -s /absolute/path/of/this/repo/libagnos/python/src /usr/lib/python2.6/site-packages/agnos
   
   Note: the link should be named "agnos"

4) Put bin/agnosc and bin/agnosrc-py in your PATH (either by chaning PATH or
   by creating symlinks to /usr/bin, etc.)

5) Build the parts of libagnos that you wish to use:
   * Java: cd to libagnos/java and run scons
   * C++: cd to libagnos/cpp and run scons
   * C#: cd to libagnos/csharp/src and run "msbuild Agnos.sln" or "xbuild Agnos.sln"
