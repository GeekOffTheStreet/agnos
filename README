==============================================================================
Agnos has been (and is being) developed at IBM XIV (http://www.xivstorage.com/), 
by Tomer Filiba (tomerf@il.ibm.com; tomerfiliba@gmail.com), and is released
as an Open Source project under the Apache 2 license.

The following information was requested to be placed here by our lawyers:
 * The design of the project had been inspired by Thrift 
   (http://incubator.apache.org/thrift), although the projects do not share 
   code. Thrift is licensed as Apache 2, which allows deriviative works.
 
 * The name "Microsoft" appears several times in the repository, in 
   Visual Studio solution and project files (.sln, .csproj, .vcxproj), as
   they reference XML schema files; in paths of some executable tools;
   and in documentation material. This does not imply that Microsoft is in 
   anyway affiliated with this project.


==============================================================================
  How to run the Agnos Toolchain from a cloned repository:
==============================================================================
1) Clone this repository

2) Create a symlink (on Windows use mklink) to agnos_compiler/src and place
   it somewherein your PYTHONPATH, e.g.:
   
   ln -s /absolute/path/of/this/repo/agnos_compiler/src /usr/lib/python2.6/site-packages/agnos_compiler
   
   Note: the link should be named "agnos_compiler"

3) Create a symlink to libagnos/python/src and place it somewhere in your 
   PYTHONPATH, e.g:

   ln -s /absolute/path/of/this/repo/libagnos/python/src /usr/lib/python2.6/site-packages/agnos
   
   Note: the link should be named "agnos"

4) Put bin/agnosc and bin/agnosrc-py in your PATH (either by chaning PATH or
   by creating symlinks to /usr/bin, etc.)

5) Build the parts of libagnos that you wish to use:
   * Java: cd to libagnos/java and run scons
   * C++: cd to libagnos/cpp and run scons
   * C#: cd to libagnos/csharp/src and run "msbuild Agnos.sln" or "xbuild Agnos.sln"
