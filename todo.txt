* intergrate with XSF

* HAK2.0:
	* HTTP stream
	* jscript client (over URLs)

* want:
	* c++
	* REST access in the meanwhile:
	    can implement REST on top of agnos, by writing a small python mediator 
	    program that acts as a client from one side, and exposes REST 
	    web access on the other

* optional features:
    * async/timed invocation
    * by-ref list, by-ref map
    * custom type templates
    * complex consts
	* authentication? encryption?
	* dynamic structs -- basically like heterogenous dicts, 
	  where keys are strings and values can be anything. each value is 
	  serialized with its type code 

* maybe targets:
	* powershell
    * c
    * perl
    * php
