Downloading Agnos
=================

Architecture
------------
Agnos consists of two parts: ``agnos_compiler`` and ``libagnos``. The 
``agnos_compiler`` is a set of utilities that generate language-bindings from
:doc:`IDL specifications <idl>`, and ``libagnos`` is a set of libraries, 
implementing the Agnos protocol for the various languages. 

In order to develop a service with Agnos, you will need the ``agnos_compiler`` 
and ``libagnos``. If you only wish to consume an Agnos service, you will only
require ``libagnos``.
